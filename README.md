# MassBank-Human

MassBank Human is a database of product ion spectra obtained from human metabolome datasets. Product ion spectra were generated from each DDA or IDA dataset in the metabolome data repositories. Levels of _m_/_z_ accuracy and S/N of product ions were improved by the spectral averaging [1]. The MassBank Human database includes product ion spectra of "Known-knowns," "Known-Unknowns," and "Unknown-unknowns".
